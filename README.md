# Inferius
Inferius (and it's sister tool, Restituere), is a tool to create and restore custom IPSWs for 64-bit devices using Firmware Bundles, similarly to xpwn for 32-bit devices.
Due to how the tool is built, this could be used for many different applications, but currently it's main use is for downgrading devices to previous iOS versions.
*Note: All custom IPSWs restored with Inferius will require you to boot your device via a computer every time your device is turned off.*

Inferius is Latin for 'below', and Restituere is Latin for 'restore'.

## Requirements
- A macOS system.
- `ldid` from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
- A 64bit device compatible with checkm8.
- A firmware bundle for the device you are wanting to restore and the version you are wanting to downgrade to.
- A brain.

## Disclaimer
- I take **NO** reponsibility for any loss of data, issues with your device, or anything else if you use Inferius. You accept those risks when you use this tool.
